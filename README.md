I am a software developer at Banco do Brasil, where I architect microservices for high availability and performance environments, utilizing technologies such as Java, Quarkus, Kubernetes, AppDynamics, Grafana, and Prometheus on a daily basis.

I have a Master's degree in Mechanical Engineering from UFRGS, specializing in computational mechanics. Throughout my academic and professional journey, I've had numerous opportunities to enhance both my technical and management skills. This includes involvement in research projects, participation in a junior enterprise, product engineering and continuous improvement internships at John Deere, and providing consultancy in numerical simulation through finite element analysis (FEA) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD).

I have knowledge and interest in:

- Programming: I use various programming languages in my daily work, including Java, Shell Script, Nix, and Fortran.
- DevOps: I have experience with DevOps practices and tools.
- Mechanical Engineering: I have extensive experience in mechanical projects, from conception to execution, with a focus on optimization and thermal, electrical, and structural analysis. I am also interested in the application of machine  learning techniques in engineering.
- Finite Element Analysis (FEA): My master's research involved the development, programming, and application of finite element methods, which share similarities with some data science methods, to solve engineering problems. Additionally, I have experience with simulation software such as Abaqus and ANSYS.
